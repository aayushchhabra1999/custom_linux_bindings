# custom_linux_bindings

## Motivation:
I had a highly configured ubuntu system until recently when my system got corrupted.
As a result of that, I lost all of my customizations.
To prevent anything like this from happening in the future,
I am making this repo to add any custom bindings that I introduce in my shell.

## Note to future self:
If you are reading this, you have probably done something stupid and lost your customizations, AGAIN.
Don't worry, I got your back.
What you need to do is make a folder in your new home directory named .custom_commands and clone this repo.
After that, set your PATH to include this directory.
The only thing left out is ssh keys and ssh config files for obvious reasons.
Do the work of again configuring these files.
-Aayush, from the past.
